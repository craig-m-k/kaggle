# Los Angeles restaurants: inspections and violations

This is an analysis of inspections & violations for Los Angeles restaurants between 07/01/2015 and 12/29/2017. 

I have taken [this](https://www.kaggle.com/meganrisdal/la-county-restaurant-inspections-and-violations) dataset and
heavily modified it to allow for visualization.  Specifically, the separate violations and inspection datasets have been
joined and augmented with geocode information.

The Jupyter notebook has a weighted heat map with time that allows for displaying custom time windows. To view the heat map, follow this link:
